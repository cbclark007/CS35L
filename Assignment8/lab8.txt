Laboratory 8: Git spelunking

In ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L

1. Working files only:
After exploring the manual page of "du", I ran:

du -s -h --exclude ".git"
Output:
159M
(or 159 megabytes)

To get the disk space used to represent the Git repository, I run:
du -s -h .git
Output:
350M
(or 350 Megabytes)

To further inspect the contents of the git repository, I run
$ du -h .git
Which outputs directory sizes under .git
I also run 
$ du -h -a .git
which includes files.

I found that the .git/objects folder consumed the most repository space, with a total
of 342M out of the 350 total. This is 97% of the space.

Within it, there was a file:
.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
That took up 311M of space.

With some research, I found that pack files are where git compresses and stores various
objects from different commits and versions. Obviously, since this is storing all the
past data, it is going to take up a lot of space.

2. # of branches local to the repository, # of branches remote

First, I look at:
man git branch

To get a list of local branches, I run:
git branch
I then ran the following to get a total number of branches:
git branch | wc -l
Output:
176

There seem to be 176 local branches.

The remote branches can be found with:
git branch -r
To get the number of lines (aka number of remote branches), I ran:
git branch -r | wc -l
Output:
177

However, origin/HEAD is not actually a branch, and it is included in the list of 
remote branches.

So, there are actually 176 remote branches.

3. Remote repositories and where they are

I read up on:
man git remote

I ran:
git remote

There was only one line of output:
origin

So it looks like there is only one repository remote to this repository.

To find out where it was located, I ran:
git remote -v

The repository is located at:
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

4. Ten local branches most recently committed to

man git for-each-ref
to learn about the git for-each-ref command

Then, I ran
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate --count=10 refs/heads
This outputted the 10 most recent branches most recently committed to:
master
scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
feature/windows-with-utils
scratch/completion-api
scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
scratch/fido-mode
feature/gnus-select2
feature/extend_face_id
scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
emacs-26

5. How many commits are in the master branch?

man git rev-list
git rev-list --count master
Output:
139583

There have been 139583 commits in the master branch.

6. % of commits in any branch also in the master branch

git rev-list HEAD --count --all
output:
143910

139583/143910 = 0.969932 ==> approximately 97%

7. 10 people who authored the most master-branch commits 2013 or later

git rev-list -s -n --since=2013-01-01

top 10 output:
3691  Eli Zaretskii
3644  Glenn Morris
3604  Paul Eggert
1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
1784  Stefan Monnier
1571  Michael Albinus
619  Dmitry Gutov
576  Noam Postavsky
471  Alan Mackenzie
469  Juri Linkov

8. gitk to visualize commit graph 

git log --pretty=oneline --merges

3342 lines were printed; I'll show the first few and the last few:
