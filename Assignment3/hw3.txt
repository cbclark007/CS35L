Homework 3:

Q1: The patch improves the performance. In the patch file,
we see:
-          if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
-            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;

This means an if statement is removed from ls.c, which would
improve performance.

Q2: If my company adopts the patched version, it would
need to pay attention to the usage of -a and -A when 
using ls since the output is now slightly different
with -a not overriding -A no matter what anymore.

Q3: When this script is invoked on an empty file like
/dev/null, an error occurs:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

The error says that the line
return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] raises IndexError
if seq is empty. Since the file is empty, there are no
lines to choose from, and therefore the script throws
an IndexError.

Q4: When I use python3 to run the script, I get an error:

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because while exceptions in python2 are iterable,
exceptions in python3 are not.

Q5: When I run my script with python2, it works fine.
This is probably because the methods/classes I used
and imported, as well as how I wrote my code, also complies
with python2.
