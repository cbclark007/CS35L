Homework (SSH Questions)

1. Other teams have been observing bytes. Is the network still secure?
Even if other people observe the bytes, the network is still secure because the data
is encrypted. Even if they tapped the keyboard, they wouldn't be able to obtain the exact
same data as I did since it's on the server and I didn't type anything that would expose
my data. However, if I were booting off a USB and they got hold of it, then my security
would be compromised because they would be able to get the keys.

2. gpg2 --verify doesn't really verify that you personally created the file in question.
Acccording to the output, gpg gives a warning that the key is not certified with a trusted
signature, and we don't know that the signature actually belongs to the owner. Anyone
can use the public key to create a signature, so we don't know if the person who created
it was the one who made the signature.

To fix this, the key should be verified by signing it with the private key. Thus, it can
become certified with a trusted signature.

Some useful commands used
gpg2 --gen-key
gpg2 --armor --export
gpg2 --armor --output sigfile --detach-sign file
gpg2 --verify sigfile file
